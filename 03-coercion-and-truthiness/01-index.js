// Coercion and Truthiness 

/*
Overview:
--------
- Type
- Explicit coercion
- Implicit coercion
  - Concatenation
  - Loose-equality operator (==)
- Coercion to boolean (truthiness)
  - Which values are truthey/falsey
  - conditional expressions
  - ! operator
  - logical operators

/*
Types:
--------
Types you've already seen:
--------------------------
  - number
  - string
  - boolean

These are all primitive types!

Other primitive types:
  - null
  - undefined
  - Symbol (not covered in this course)

"Complex" or "object" types:
---------------------------
- functions
- arrays (will cover later)
- objects (will cover later)

Major differences between primitive and complex types:

  - only complex types can be mutated (will cover later)
  - primitive types are passed by value, complex types are passed by reference (will cover later)
