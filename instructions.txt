Hello in order to run a particular file you first have to change to the appropriate folder

If you want to run the file '04-scope/08-block-scope'

You will need to type in the following
# switch to the folder 04-scope
cd 04-scope 
# run file 08-block-scope
node 08-block-scope 

once you've done 'cd' once you won't have to do it again
